<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solvent-free Polyurethane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocomponent</li><li>Bi-component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solvent-free polyurethane market includes two main types: monocomponent and bi-component systems. Monocomponent polyurethane consists of a single formulation that cures when exposed to moisture, making it easy to apply and ideal for various applications. In contrast, bi-component polyurethane involves mixing two separate components—a resin and a hardener—before application, allowing for greater control over curing time and properties. Both types are popular in sectors like construction and automotive for their environmental benefits and performance characteristics.</p></p>
